## Pull Requests

-   **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

-   **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

-   **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

-   **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

-   **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
