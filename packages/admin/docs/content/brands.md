# Brands
Most e-commerce sites sell products from several manufacturers. And each supplier can be represented by a brand.

Unless you make your own products, you'll be registering your product's brands in Shopper.

If you sell your own products, you must at least create your company as a brand: this helps your customer find what they are looking for, and this can bring some valuable search engine points.

## Overview

The management of brands is exactly the same as the one done in most of the e-commerce website creation tools: only the name can change.
It is mainly used to facilitate the navigation of customers in your catalog, as it is increasingly common to search for a specific brand.

New brands are automatically activated and available for your online store, even if they do not contain any products yet. You must deactivate them so that they do not appear online.

:::tip
Models are customizable, and we recommend changing the **Brand** model when you configure your site.
To change the model you need to look at the configuration file `config/shopper/models.php`.
:::

```php
use Shopper\Core\Models;

return [
    // ...
    'brand' => Models\Brand::class,
];
```

1. Create your own Model
    ```bash
    php artisan make:model Brand
    ```
    Once the `app/Models/Brand.php` model is created in your app folder, you need to extend from the `Shopper\Core\Models\Brand` Model.

2. Extend our Brand model from the Brand Shopper Model
    ```php
    namespace App\Models;

    use Shopper\Core\Models\Brand as Model;

    class Brand extends Model
    {
    }
    ```

3. Update `brand` key for the model on the `models.php` config file to use our new model
    ```php
    'brand' => Models\Brand::class, // [tl! --]
    'brand' => \App\Models\Brand::class, // [tl! ++]
    ```

### Components
By default, brands Livewire components are not published. To customize components, you must publish them.

```bash
php artisan shopper:component:publish brand
```

This command will publish all Livewire components used for brand management (from pages to form components).
Once you've published the component, you can find it in the `brand.php` locate in the `config/shopper/components` folder.

```php
use Shopper\Livewire;

return [
  'pages' => [
        'brand-index' => Livewire\Pages\Brand\Index::class,
    ],
    
    'components' => [
        'slide-overs.brand-form' => Livewire\SlideOvers\BrandForm::class,
    ],
];
```

## Manage Brands

The brands are accessible via the Brands Menu on the left sidebar.
You can update the livewire page component in the configuration file to use your own.

To create a Livewire page for Shopper you need to run the following command

```bash
php artisan make:shopper-page Brand
```

This page will extend shopper's default layout, and you can render the view you want.

### Create brand

Click on the "Create" button on the brands page, which will display the form.

<div class="screenshot">
  <img src="/img/screenshots/{{version}}/create-brand.png" alt="Create brand">
  <div class="caption">Create brand</div>
</div>

Save your changes in order to be taken back to the brand's list. Required fields are marked with an **asterisk (*)**

## Retrieve Data

Once you have your brands you want to display them in your store, you can retrieve them this way in your controller

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Brand;
use App\Models\Product;
use Carbon\Carbon;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
  public function __invoke()
  {
    $products = Product::with('categories', 'attributes')
      ->publish()
      ->take(8)
      ->get()
      ->map(function ($product) {
        $product['is_new'] = $product->created_at
          ->addDays(8)
          ->greaterThanOrEqualTo(Carbon::now());

        return $product;
    });

    return view('home', [
      'products' =>  $products,
      'brands' => Brand::query()->get()->take(12), // [tl! focus]
    ]);
  }
}
```

:::tip
Knowing that your brands can be displayed on several pages and places in your store website, you can create a **View Composer** ([read more about View Composer](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/views#view-composers)).
:::

- Create your brand composer undo a custom folder `app/View/Composers`

```php
namespace App\View\Composers;

use App\Models\Brand;
use Illuminate\View\View;

class BrandsComposer
{
    public function compose(View $view): void
    {
        $view->with('brands', Brand::enabled()->get()->take(12));
    }
}
```

- Then you have to add it in your **AppServiceProvider**

```php
    
namespace App\Providers;

use App\View\Composers\BrandsComposer;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        View::composer('partials.brands', BrandsComposer::class); // [tl! focus]
    }
}
```

And in your front-end you can browse your brands to have a display like this

<div class="screenshot">
  <img src="/img/screenshots/{{version}}/brand-lists.png" alt="Brands list">
  <div class="caption">Brands example list</div>
</div>

## Disabled Brand

Sometimes in your store, you won't have a brand name for your products (it's rare but possible), especially if you make them yourself.
In this case, you can hide brands on the sidebar and disabled all brand-related functionalities in your store.

To disable brands-related functionalities, open the `features.php` configuration file in the `config/shopper` folder and set the brand key to disable.

```php
use Shopper\Enum\FeatureState;

return [
    'attribute' => FeatureState::Enabled,
    'brand' => FeatureState::Enabled, // [tl! --]
    'brand' => FeatureState::Disabled, // [tl! ++]
    'category' => FeatureState::Enabled,
    'collection' => FeatureState::Enabled,
    'discount' => FeatureState::Enabled,
    'review' => FeatureState::Enabled,
];
```
