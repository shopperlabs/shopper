# Contribution Guide

Contributions are accepted via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/shopperlabs/framework).

## Bug Reports
To encourage active collaboration, Shopper strongly encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test.

## Pull Requests
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!

## Security Vulnerabilities
