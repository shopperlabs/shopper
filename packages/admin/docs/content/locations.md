# Locations

By default, when you install Shopper for the first time, you configure and create your shop and this allows you to create a first location which will have the information you defined. 
This is the initial location in which all products are stored.

If you have already used [Shopify](https://shopify.com) it's a bit the same model, but a little simpler so that you can update it because the system is accessible for any type of business.

You can set up multiple locations in your store so that you can track inventory and have Excel documents of the products ordered in each of your locations. 
Your locations can be *retail stores*, *warehouses*, *popups*, or any other place where you manage or store inventory. With multiple locations, you have better visibility into your inventory in your business.

A location is a physical place or space where you perform any or all of the following activities: Selling products, shipping or fulfillment orders, and inventory (this may even be your apartment).

## Setup locations

From the administration area of your store you can't manage more than 4 inventories. This system being still experimental we are working on it to make it simpler to facilitate the management of your store.
You can change this value if you want to be able to manage many more inventories. The configuration to update is in the file `config/shopper/admin.php` on the key `inventory_limit`.

```php filename=config/shopper/admin.php
'inventory_limit' => 4,
```

### Components

The components used to manage locations are found in the component configuration file `config/shopper/components/setting.php`.
This configuration file is not available by default. But if you want to update or change the settings components, you can publish them with the command

```bash
php artisan shopper:component:publish setting
```

This file contains all Livewire components for settings. Here is only the list of inventory components

```php
use Shopper\Livewire\Pages;

return [

    'pages' => [
        // ...
        'inventory-index' => Pages\Settings\Inventories\Browse::class,
        'inventory-create' => Pages\Settings\Inventories\Create::class,
        'inventory-edit' => Pages\Settings\Inventories\Edit::class,
        // ...
    ];
    
    'components' => [
        // ...
    ],

];
```

You can expand each of its components to customize this section or replace the entire section if your system requires it.

You can also change the views too and return your own views.
